### Keep track of who is writing what and when with My Quota.

Take control of your workflow process for writing and publishing articles in a timely fashion with My Quota. Save time and money by keeping an automated record of who is posting what and when with the My Quota plugin.

#### Automate Your Quota Keeping

No, everything you need to track users is already with the plugin.
